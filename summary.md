The `RootLayout` component in this file serves as the top-level layout of your Next.js application. It is responsible for wrapping all child components passed to it and applying a few key features:

- **Global Styling**: It uses the imported `inter` font configuration, applying it to the `<body>` tag for consistent typography across the application.

- **Amplify Integration**: The `ConfigureAmplifyClientSide` component is included to ensure that AWS Amplify is properly configured for the client-side, allowing interactions with Amplify services.

- **Toast Notifications**: The `ToastProvider` component manages notifications, and the `Toast` component renders any active notifications at the top level of the app.

- **Semantic HTML**: The children components are wrapped in a `<main>` element, which improves accessibility and semantic structure without altering the layout.

- **Next.js Metadata**: SEO metadata such as the page title and description is defined using the `Metadata` type from Next.js and helps optimize search engine visibility.


This component leverages **Next.js's App Router** and **React** features, ensuring SEO and accessibility optimizations while integrating **AWS Amplify** for backend services.
