/* globals.css
   Purpose: This file sets up global styles that are applied across the entire application.
   It leverages Tailwind CSS to manage base, component, and utility styles, ensuring a consistent and modern design language.

   The `@tailwind` directives import various layers of Tailwind's utility classes,
   while custom styles within the `@layer base` are defined to tailor the foundational appearance of HTML elements. */

   @tailwind base;     /* Imports the base styles from Tailwind, which reset and normalize default browser styles. */
   @tailwind components; /* Imports component styles, allowing the definition of CSS classes that are reusable across components. */
   @tailwind utilities; /* Imports utility classes from Tailwind, providing a wide range of quick-to-apply styles for spacing, sizing, typography, and more. */
   
   /* Define base layer modifications:
      This section customizes the default styling of HTML elements, particularly the <body> tag,
      to ensure that the application has a unified look and feel from the start. */
   @layer base {
       body {
           @apply bg-black text-white; /* Sets the background color to black and the text color to white for all text within the <body>. */
       }
   }

   @layer components {
    .memberBtn {
        @apply w-24 mx-2 mt-4 text-xs text-white py-2 px-3 rounded-md shadow-md;
    }
   }
   
   /* Additional styles can be added here as needed to further customize the application's global aesthetics. */
